# ProxyFire Configuration File
# Copy to proxyfire.toml and edit as needed.

# Usage: proxyfire --config proxyfire.toml -- <target.exe> [args...]

[general]
# Enable verbose logging (shows every connection attempt)
verbose = false

# DNS leak prevention: intercept DNS queries and resolve through SOCKS5 proxy
# This prevents your real DNS from seeing which domains you connect to.
dns_leak_prevention = true

# Inject hook DLL into child processes spawned by the target
inject_children = false

# Log to file (leave empty for no file logging)
# log_file = "proxyfire.log"

# Log level: trace, debug, info, warn, error
log_level = "info"

# Proxy connection timeout in milliseconds
timeout = 30000

# Proxy chain - connections are tunneled through proxies in order.
# Multiple [[proxy]] sections create a chain (multi-hop).

[[proxy]]
# SOCKS5 proxy with authentication
# uri = "socks5://username:password@proxy-server.com:1080"

# SOCKS5 proxy without authentication
uri = "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"

# Uncomment to add a second hop (proxy chaining):
# [[proxy]]
# uri = "socks5://second-proxy.com:1080"

# HTTP CONNECT proxy example:
# [[proxy]]
# uri = "http://user:pass@http-proxy.com:8080"

# SOCKS4/4a proxy examples:
# [[proxy]]
# uri = "socks4://socks4-proxy.com:1080"
# [[proxy]]
# uri = "socks4a://socks4a-proxy.com:1080"

[bypass]
# Comma-separated CIDR rules for addresses that should NOT go through the proxy.
# Loopback (127.0.0.0/8) is always bypassed automatically.
rules = "10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16"
